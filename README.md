# Vanilla JavaScript Canvas Editor

This repository contains an **early-stage project** I developed while learning **JavaScript**.  
The goal was to explore the **HTML5 Canvas API** by building a lightweight editor that allows users to draw, import images, and adjust elements—similar in concept to simple design tools.  

Although the project is **not finished**, it represents an important step in my learning journey and experimentation with front-end development.

## Features (Work in Progress)
- Freehand drawing on canvas  
- Basic element resizing  
- Image import support  
- Text element placement  
- Built with **pure JavaScript**, no external frameworks  

---

## Project Status
This project is **incomplete** and was created primarily as a **learning exercise**.  
It is not production-ready, but it demonstrates:
- Practical use of the Canvas API  
- Event handling and user interactions  
- Dynamic rendering without external libraries  

---

## Lessons Learned
- Structuring front-end projects without frameworks  
- Handling real-time user input on the canvas  
- Fundamentals of DOM and canvas manipulation  
- Early understanding of scalable project design  

---

## Possible Future Improvements
- Layer management system  
- Color picker and font customization  
- Export and save functionality  
- Enhanced UI/UX design

## Note
This is an **old project** from my early JavaScript practice.  
It remains unfinished but serves as a milestone in my development journey, showing where I started and how far I’ve progressed.
