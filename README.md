# Editor
I created a lightweight canvas editor using only vanilla JavaScript, with no frameworks. It lets users import images, draw freely, add text, and resize elements dynamically. The goal was to provide a simplified “mini-Canva” experience in the browser, keeping the project clean, efficient, and fully interactive.
